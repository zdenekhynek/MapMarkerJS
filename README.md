MapMarkerJS
==========

Create rich interactive Google Maps markers.

The MapMarkerJS library enables you to create Google Maps Markers from any HTML content ( including videos, iframes, vector graphics, flash files etc. ). Furthemore the HMTL within marker is  is still fully accessible so you can create truly animated and fully interactive markers.

Even with Symbols introduced recently, I didn't find a way in Google Maps Api V3 to have creative freedom similar to the Flash version of API.

The class takes advantage of the google.maps.OverlayView.

There are three examples included with img elements, embedded youtube videos and gRaphael piecharts used as markers.

This is heavily "work in progress" and there might be some issues with performance, or certain dom elements.
